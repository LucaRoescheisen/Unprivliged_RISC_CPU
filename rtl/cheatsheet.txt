R-type Instruction
funct7[31:25] rs2[24:20] rs1[19:15] funct3[14:12] rd[11:7] opcode[6:0]

I-type Instruction
imm[31:20] rs1[19:15] funct3[14:12] rd[11:7] opcode[6:0]




Load:
  According to manual: The effective address is obtained by adding register rs1 to the
  sign-extended 12-bit offset.
  Reason being, lets say you have the following:
  struct Student {
    int id,     //Offset 0
    int grade,  //Offset 4 bytes
    int age     //Offset 8 bytes
  }
  In asm it looks like this:
  lw x5, 0(x10)      # Load ID    (Address: x10 + 0)
  lw x6, 4(x10)      # Load Grade (Address: x10 + 4)
  lw x7, 8(x10)      # Load Age (Address: x10 + 8)
  We add rs1 to offset to quickly and efficienctly find another value that is part of the data structure.
